# open62541-sys

open62541-sys aims to be a rust sys-crate that allows to use the [open62541](https://open62541.org/) implementation of [OPC UA](https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/).

## Current Focus

At the moment, the goal is to create a very simple OPC UA server that is easy to use from rust. 
Therefore I will try to create a minimal set of convenience methods for the genereated datatypes.
